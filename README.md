# oradcn-demo

This is a simple JDBC demo of the Oracle Database Change Notification
feature, implemented in Clojure using clojure.java.jdbc and other
auxiliary packages.

It's a more or less direct convertion of the online Java DCN examples,
and it's not likely to be very "idiomatic" since my knowledge of
Clojure is superficial at best.

After passing some command line arguments (used to establish the
database connection) this program will wait for notification and
simply print the notification event to standard output.


## Installation

Download from https://github.com/fsmunoz/oradcn-demo, the demo uses
leiningen so should be trivial.

One import point is that the ojdbc6.jar file (the Oracle Thin JDBC
driver) is not distributed as part of this demo and must be obtained
from Oracle (or a locally installed copy used). The location of the
jar must be changed in the project.clj file. 

For development Oracle 11.2 XE was used, including the built-in demo tables.

## Usage

Simply launch it via lein as per the example below
